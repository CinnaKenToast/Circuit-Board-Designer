If you don't have a way to make differently shaped buttons from the given functions:
Pallet wheel:
1) Initial/Collapsed State:
	1.1) Circular button with logo:
		1.1.1) Design:
			1.1.1.1) A circle with the logo image overlayed on it (or whatever shape you initially
			have in mind for the collapsed pallet wheel)
		1.1.2) Usage:
			1.1.2.1) Hovering State:
				1.1.2.1.1) Given the dimensions of the circle (radius and position) check
				that the mouse position is within the button's radius of the button's position
				1.1.2.1.2) Ex: circle at (20, 40) with radius 10. Check if
				[sqrt((mousex-20)^2 + (mousey-40)^2)] <= 10. This should alow you to put some
				sort of highlighting/expanding effect on the button if the mouse is over it.
			1.1.2.2) Mouse Down State:
				1.1.2.2.1) Check if (...will continue in a bit...)
