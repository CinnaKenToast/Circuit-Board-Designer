NOTES:
======
- Run VSCode as Admin
- Run XLaunch
- Move to proper directory
- Open Virtual Machine by going to directory and doing Command ".\Script\activate"

- In order to make "Joseph_Virtual_Environment" work on other devices (I think) all you need to do after downloading
is change the location in the "settings.json" under the .vscode folder.





COMMANDS:
=========
"start-process PowerShell -verb runas" - Start a new PowerShell as Admin
"pyuic5 -x <Designer File Name>.ui -o <Output File Name>.py" - Convert Designer save to Python file
"Get-History |  Select-String -Pattern "Example" " - Searches command history for anything with "Example"
"deactivate" - Will deactivate the current virtual machine and bring back normal PowerShell
"pip3 install PyQt5Designer" - Installs a folder with Qt Designer in it. QTDesigner Folder contains the application.
