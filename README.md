# Circuit-Board-Designer

The Circuit Board Designer has been developed to be an easy-to-use tool to develop circuit diagrams efficiently and for those who may be lacking experience. The Circuit Board Designer offers a lot of features, but the most important is itâ€™s simple and easy to understand graphical user interface (GUI) which allows the user to generate their own basic circuit within minutes. The Circuit Board Designer also provides functionality to convert the circuit diagram to a physical component layout that fits optimally on a printable circuit board (PCB). This function allows the user to be able to quickly develop their optimal layout for a compact circuit. This program also has the ability to give the user an image of their optimal PCB layout.
