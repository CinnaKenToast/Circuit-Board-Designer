# Circuit-Board-Designer

The Circuit Board Designer has been developed to be an easy-to-use tool to develop circuit diagrams efficiently and for those who may be lacking experience. The Circuit Board Designer offers a lot of features, but the most important is itâ€™s simple and easy to understand graphical user interface (GUI) which allows the user to generate their own basic circuit within minutes. The Circuit Board Designer also provides functionality to convert the circuit diagram to a physical component layout that fits optimally on a printable circuit board (PCB). This function allows the user to be able to quickly develop their optimal layout for a compact circuit. This program also has the ability to give the user an image of their optimal PCB layout.

This GitHub repository is organized as follows:

## Documents

This directory includes all of the documents throughout the CSCI 4805 Course. This includes word documents and powerpoints which (some of which are saved as .pdf files) from various milestones of this project.

## examples

This directory is solely used to give the user examples on how to use different parts of the backend program. It is also used for testing purposes by the developers. 

## src

This is the source directory of the entire project.

<ins>color_img</ins>
: Contains all of the different .png files for the color-related buttons on the GUI.

<ins>comp_img</ins>
: Contains all of the different .svg files for the components on the workspace of the GUI.

<ins>img</ins>
: Contains all of the different .png files for the other buttons not included in the color_img folder.
